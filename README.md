# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
This Python-based simulation project models an intelligent traffic management system that dynamically regulates traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle counts. Designed for urban intersections, it aims to optimize traffic flow and minimize congestion by adjusting green light durations according to the volume of vehicles in each direction.
